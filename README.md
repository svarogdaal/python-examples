Here are some python scripts I write while learning to code.

truth_tables.py
    - reads and translates standard propositional logic syntax into python's functional syntax
    - checks the formulas for bad syntax
    - contains operator definitions
    - draws the truth table for formulas with up to 10 propositional variables
    
war_card_game.py
    - the classic card game "War" implemented in python with classes
